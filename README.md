# repository.gman

G-Man is a simple repo which contains Add-ons that I have personally forked and placed in my other repositories. Please note that although I did spend time forking these add-ons, I take no credit for the coding. That was done by developers much smarter than me. I simply changed a couple simple files and added my own icons.

I created this repo to host my own current add-ons and any future add-ons I may decide to create. I don't have any long term plans, I just play with Kodi to keep my mind distracted. I may switch to weaving baskets next year, or do something that actually makes me money. LOL

The Repo Source Installer add-on is also located in the G-Source repo

The Mega IPTV add-on is also located in the G-Live repo
